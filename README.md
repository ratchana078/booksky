🧠 How It Works
When you add a book, its details are saved in your browser’s localStorage.
When you refresh or reopen the page, all saved books are automatically loaded.
You can delete books anytime — it updates both the display and localStorage instantly.

Add search and filter options
Add a “read/unread” status
